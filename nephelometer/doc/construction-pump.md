## Peristaltic Pump

### Part information
* Peristaltic pump: 
  * Boxer 9K 12VDC 315 rpm 3 roller, Boxer 9022.000
    
    We have used exclusively this pump in our work.
    
  * Boxer 9QQ 12VDC 315 rpm 3 roller, Boxer 9022.930
  
    This pump is recommended as a replacement for the 9K in new designs. The tubing and mounting appear physically compatible with the 9K. The pumping rate is slightly faster: 55 µl per revolution as opposed to 48 µl per revolution with the Boxer 9K, and the same angular speed.

* Two-circuit screw-connector barrier strip: Molex Eurostyle 39100-1902, Digi-Key WM12408-ND
* M2 x 12mm pan head phillips screw, 316 stainless: McMaster-Carr 90116A022
* M2 hex nut, 316 stainless: McMaster-Carr 94150A305 
* M3 x 12mm pan head phillips screw, 316 stainless: McMaster-Carr 90116A157	
* M3 hex nut, 316 stainless: McMaster-Carr 94150A325	

### Assembly

The peristaltic pump is mounted on a 3-D printed housing and wired to a barrier strip on the same housing, which is connected to a 2-conductor JST cable.

1. Flip the cover latch up until you can pull the cover off of the pump
1. Insert the pump motor body into the large hole on the pump stand
1. Align the mounting holes on the pump face with the mounting holes on the stand.
1. Insert M3 x 12mm screws into the holes
1. Thread M3 hex nuts onto the other ends of the screws and tighten
1. Align the hole in the center of the barrier strip with a hole on the side of the pump stand.
1. Thread an M2 screw through the aligned holes. Attach an M2 hex nut on the other end and tighten.
1. Cut matched 5cm pieces of red and black hookup wire. Strip a short length on each end.
1. Thread one end of the red wire through the solder tab marked with a small `+`, twist it around, and solder it.
1. Solder the black wire onto the other solder tab in the same way.
1. Cut two short (~1 cm) pieces of heat shrink tubing
