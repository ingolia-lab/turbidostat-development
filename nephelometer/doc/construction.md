## Constructing the Turbidostat

Turbidostat construction is broken down into several individual components:

1. [Electronics](./construction-electronics.md) to assemble the printed circuit board
1. [Housing](./construction-housing.md) to print the enclosure and mount the assembled circuit
1. [Pump](./construction-pump.md) to mount and wire the media pump
1. [Fluidics](./construction-fluidics.md) to assemble the growth chamber, media reservoir, and other associated fluidics
